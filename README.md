A Symfony project created on April 17, 2017, 7:51 am.

Are you fed up with asking yourself what to cook for the kids today ? 
Tired of going to the supermarket several times a week ? Eating the same shit every week ? Wasting precious ressources ?

Click on a button and the program makes a full planning of your meals for the whole week
Then prints the groceries to buy (doesnt buy it for you yet, unfortunately)

So everyday you just follow brainlessly the receipes planned for you
and then you eat something good with all your family
while your mind can think of something else !
